# YX web engine
A for-fun project creating a simple enough web engine from scratch in kotlin android without any external dependencies (except kotlin stdlib)

## Goal
 - Make a simple enough web engine that could render common html tags, common css properties, and simple JS stuff (not planning on doing full implementation of everything)
 - No external deps (except the kotlin stdlib ofc)
 - Do it fully in kotlin

## why?
To have **fun** and learning experience
